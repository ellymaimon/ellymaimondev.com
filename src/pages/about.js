        I am a software and web developer with a rich background in graphic
        design. While studying Physics in college, I felt the need to shift to a
        more creative major, and made an about-face to the world of Graphic
        Design. I studied the fundamentals of visual communication, where I took
        my first class in user interfaces and digital media and inadvertently
        fell in love with the coding aspects (also, I couldnâ€™t draw).
      </p>

        Since then, Iâ€™ve been working in food service while living in a handful
        of different cities along the West Coast. Iâ€™ve bolstered my
        communication skills, work ethic, ability to collaborate, and ability to
        lead, and am now an effective leader and mediator.

        In 2018, I attended a web development boot camp at Epicodus, where I
        learned to write clean, best-practice, and test-driven code while using
        my graphic deisgn knowledge to create robust UI experiences. Iâ€™m adept
        at bridging the gap between form and function while keeping the user in
        mind.
